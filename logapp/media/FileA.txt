Computer hardware understands only 1’s and 0’s, so instructions are encoded as binary numbers in a format called machine language. 
Just as we use letters to encode human language, computers use binary numbers to encode machine language. The ARM architecture 
represents each instruction as a 32-bit word.Microprocessors are digital systems that read and execute machine language instructions.
However, humans consider reading machine language to be tedious, so we prefer to represent the instructions in a symbolic format called assembly language.
