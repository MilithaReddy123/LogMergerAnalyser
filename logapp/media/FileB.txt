The computerâ€™s vocabulary is called the instruction set. All programs running on a computer use the same instruction 
set. Even complex software applications, such as word processing and spreadsheet applications, are eventually compiled 
into a series of simple instructions such as add, subtract, and branch. Computer instructions indicate both the operation 
to perform and the operands to use. The operands may come from memory, from registers, or from the instruction itself.

The instruction sets of different architectures are more like different dialects than different languages. Almost all architectures 
define basic instructions, such as add, subtract, and branch, that operate on memory or registers.
Once you have learned one instruction set, understanding others is fairly straightforward.
